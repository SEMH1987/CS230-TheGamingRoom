Completed software design document for- The Gaming Room 
## Reflection on Software Design Document - "Draw It or Lose It"

The Gaming Room client wanted a multi-platform web-based version of their game, expanding from Android only. I think I did well keeping the design organized and using object-oriented principles like Singleton and Iterator. I started out a little iffy, but after putting in a lot of reading and listening to instructions, I got the hang of everything pretty well. Writing the design document first helped me plan out the code and understand the requirements and constraints before coding. 

If I could revise something, I’d expand the evaluation section with more testing results for server performance. I made sure the user’s needs, like synchronized gameplay across devices, were reflected in the design. In the future, I’d continue using UML diagrams and iterative reviews to make the design clearer and easier to implement.
